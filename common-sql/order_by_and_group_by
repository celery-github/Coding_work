### Group by ###
#Use case: Aggregating data and grouping rows based on a specified column or columns.
#Example: Suppose you have a sales table containing orders with information such as product, quantity sold, and sales date. 
#You might want to know the total quantity sold for each product

SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;

### Order by ###
#Use case: Sorting the result set based on one or more columns.
#Example: Continuing with the previous example, 
#you might want to see the products with the highest total quantity sold at the top of the result set

SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;
