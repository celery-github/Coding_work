### Question: the top 5 customers by department, ranked by the total amount of money they've spent. 
Adjustments may be needed based on the specific structure of your database schema.

### Answer and explanation:
# The WITH clause is used to create a common table expression (CTE) named ranked_customers, 
which calculates the total amount spent by each customer in each department and ranks them based on the amount spent within each department.

# The ROW_NUMBER() function is used to assign a ranking to each customer within their respective department, 
ordered by the total amount spent (in descending order).

# The main query then selects the customer_id, department_id, and total_spent columns from the ranked_customers CTE, 
filtering only the top 5 customers in each department based on their rankings.
 
# Finally, the results are sorted by department_id and total_spent in descending order to display the top-spending customers within each department.


WITH ranked_customers AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        department_id,
        SUM(amount) AS total_spent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS department_rank
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, department_id
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    department_id,
    total_spent
FROM ranked_customers
WHERE department_rank <= 5
ORDER BY department_id, total_spent DESC;
